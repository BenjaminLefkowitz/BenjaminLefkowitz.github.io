			<p> The three New York area teams, NY Rangers, NY Islanders, and NJ Devils have storied histories with both major triumphs and team disappointments. The venues for all three teams have gone through renovations and changes as well. For this project I looked at the attendance of all three teams over the past thirty years. Taking into account several changes for the arenas including the Devils’ move from the Meadowlands to the Prudential Center in the 2007-08 season, the switch for the Islanders from the Nassau Coliseum to Barclays Center, and then to their current home at UBS Arena, and the renovations that occurred at Madison Square Garden. Throughout all of these changes, attendance for games never faltered, but one team stood out above the rest.</p>

			
			<p> The Rangers, an iconic original six team in the NHL, who plays at the world most famous arena, Madison Square Garden, had the highest attendance based on area capacity out of all the teams. Throughout the twenty years, the data showed the Rangers having a  consistently higher attendance than both the Islanders and Devils. In the first figure displaying season attendance as a percentage of the area capacity the Rangers never faltered under 94 percent of Madison Square Garden being filled. While the team had on-ice success what makes going to Ranger games extremely appealing is the reputation and experience of Madison Square Garden. </p>

			<p> For the Islanders especially, the switch from the Nassau Coliseum to Barclays Center has taken a toll on attendance. Despite a larger capacity in Brooklyn at the Barclays Center, there was a dip in the percent of arena capacity since the move, as seen in the first figure. In addition, a New York Times Article supports the notion that attendance has suffered since the move in 2015. In the 2019 season, the article notes that the Islanders were last in attendance, averaging just under 12,000 fans per game. Despite the fact that the team had a new head coach in Barry Trotz, and was first in the Metropolitan Division (Kreda 2019). </p>

			<h3> The Mecca Stands Out </h3>
			<p> The iconic venue is not only a must-see attraction for visitors in New York City, but a social hub for New Yorkers as well. From die hard fans to business Madison Square Garden is always a packed house from afternoon to night games. The arena is not only as a premier sports venue but served as a major New York City landmark, tourist destination, and social gathering location  for New Yorkers. From dedicated Rangers fans to business professionals attending evening games, MSG consistently attracts full crowds regardless of weekday, opponent, or team record. Sean Pecora, a membership and sales representative for MSG Sports notes the prestige and reputation of MSG play a major factor in attendance for Ranger games.</p>

<p> “Like being at MSG, it's such a status thing to a lot of people that they just want to get in the building and say that they went to a game at MSG,” Pecora explained.  
After working with the team last year, where the Rangers failed to make the playoffs, Pecora noted that performance had no real factor on attendance. </p>
<p>“For example, like the Rangers not making the playoffs last year, you would think it would be hard to sell tickets coming into the season, but we had the centennial year.  So there's different animals you could find to sell if team performance isn't going great” noted Pecora. </p>

<p> Whereas for Pecora’s other jobs, like the Brooklyn Nets, were solely performance-based attached to wins and losses.  Because of the reputation, prestige, and appeal of Madison Square Garden, hockey fans and regulars are attracted to the venue. The data reflects this reality that over the past twenty years the Rangers are consistently the attendance leader in the New York area.</p>

			<h3> Does Performance Really Matter?</h3>
			
			<p> While fans of the Rangers, Islanders, and Devils, always enjoy young games when their teams are winning, performance doesn't always equate to higher attendance. While both teams had highs and lows over the past twenty years, all three made the playoffs more than five times. However, making the playoffs didn’t always equate to higher attendance and fans filling up the arenas. </p>


<p> The Rangers had the most playoff appearances with 14 over the past twenty years, but arena attendance remained constant even when they didn’t make the postseason. In fact, the average attendance percent of arena capacity for Madison Square Garden when the Rangers made the playoffs was 98.78 percent, but when they failed to make the playoffs it was 99.00 percent. </p>

<p> The Devils had a similar trend as the Rangers. There was a bigger percent change for when the Devils made the playoffs 13 times to when they missed it. The Islanders had a high percent average attendance of arena capacity with the season they missed the playoffs. It was 91.23 percent when the Devils missed the playoffs, but 85.19 percent when they made it. </p>

<p> The Islanders were the only team that had a higher average attendance percent of arena capacity when they made the playoffs 12 times over the past 20 years. There was 89.23 percent of attendance of arena capacity when the Islanders made the layoffs, but 82.04 percent when they didn’t.</p>

			<p>  Success and attendance had no direct relationship for attendance for the Rangers, Islanders, and Devils. Among the three teams, the Rangers had the highest attendance of arena capacity due to the prestige and allure of Madison Square Garden. Overall the data takes in account all of the changes across the three teams, while demonstrating that attendance factors are not solely based on play. </p>
